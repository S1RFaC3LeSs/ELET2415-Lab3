# Hydromonitor Pt. 1
# Internet of Things (IoT) Template - Hydroponics Monitoring System(Hydromonitor) 

### Description
The hardware is tasked with the remote control of the colour spectrum (frequency of light), the number of activated LEDs, and the brightness of the lighting within the Hydroponics system. To monitor the farm environment, the hardware employs a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. The heat index must be calculated based on the sensor's data. The collected sensor data must be published to a topic subscribed to by both the backend and frontend segments of the system. Furthermore, the hardware must process and execute actions in response to messages published to the topics to which it is subscribed. This comprehensive functionality ensures seamless control, monitoring, and responsiveness within the hydroponic cultivation environment.

The backend is tasked with storing data, published by the hardware, in the database following the schema specified in the hardware specifications. Additionally, it is responsible for making the stored data in the database accessible to the frontend through API routes.

The frontend plays a pivotal role in delivering three distinct user interfaces. These interfaces encompass controls for managing the system's lighting, real-time visualization of data generated by the environmental monitoring sensors, and the ability to visualize as well as perform statistical analysis on the data stored in the database. This multifaceted approach ensures a comprehensive and user-friendly experience, empowering users to efficiently interact with and derive insights from the hydroponics system.
